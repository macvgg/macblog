      how i gave the games in macvg actual hrefs for links when using js to
      generte them with the filtering/sorting feature
    </h1>
    <p>
      so with my old js code, when generating the games and arranging them
      according to the users filters and sorting stuff, the games only have
      correct tiels and background images, but they dont have the file path for
      the actual link in the href attribute, because i forgot to set them in the
      games.json file, where i use it for the game generation. its too much work
      to do that anyway. so when i tried to fix this bug, i used the id already
      set in the games to extract the url from the css file via
      getcomputedstyle, and then modify that url to match it with the actual
      game page's url, and then paste it only the game element. this way, the
      game becomes a link thats actually clickable, while the new filtering and
      sorting features are still working.
