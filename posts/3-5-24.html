      What we decided to do regarding the crap download button in macvg
    </h1>
    Because of many good reasons, we're deciding to shut down the download button in macvg, because of:
    <ul>
      <li>More than 80% of the games won't work when downloading and running on file protocol, because they use Unity engine.</li>
      <li>There are way too many requests to process and most of them won't work</li>
      <li>There are legal and ethical issues of licensing, distributing, and copyright issues.</li>
      <li>Going to google form for download request is unprofessional</li>
    </ul>
    So we decided to just completely remove the download button on all the games that don't work, and provide a download button on games that have free distribution license and work when on file protocol, so we can elimate 3 problems. We also decided to remove the google form and google drive and all that madness, instead, we simply zipped the folder (a very clever and smart solution) and when the user clicks on the download button, the zipped folder will automatically download, and the user can unzip it and enjoy. This way, they can play copy-right free games offline while we don't need to process that much download requests.
