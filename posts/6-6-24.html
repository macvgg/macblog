  <h1>i finally figured out what's causing the problem of iframe not typable!!!</h1>
  <p>so theres been a problem on macvg ever since the huge january update that came out on 1/1/2024, and that's not being able to type on certain games which makes the games almost unplayable and the experience is terrible. but in the process of doing the july update for macvg, we went through the javascript files to optimize the files and make it less laggy and building with performance in mind. we checked through each code, until we came across this event listener that prevents keydown event's default actions, aka typing in games. we have no idea why that piece of code was there, and after removing it, the bug is finally solved and now you can type in so many games, and thanks to your user feedbacks, we get to know this issue and fix it! this only fixed the bug, and didn't have any negative impact!!! you can now enjoy tons of games like vex series, google feud, mario, minecraft, and more!!!</p>
