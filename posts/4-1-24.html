        Today was a really bad day because GitHub Desktop couldn't handle
        updating the huge game site, making MacVG unavailable. The April update
        for MacVG was pretty big, so I copied the entire folder to the remote
        repository. But GitHub Desktop took forever to update and push it,
        causing the remote to disconnect multiple times. I had deleted all the
        files beforehand, so the game site was completely empty.
      </p>
      <p class="post-paragraph">
        I tried a lot of solutions, and nothing worked until I realized that
        GitHub Desktop only pushes the changed files each time. So, I divided
        the MacVG folder into smaller sections and uploaded each section one by
        one. It took a long time, but I gradually uploaded 30 games at a time,
        then 40, then 50, repeating until all the games and other files were
        uploaded to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p class="post-paragraph">
        That's how we fixed this huge MacVG issue in just 2 hours. Let's go!
