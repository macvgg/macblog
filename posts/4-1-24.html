    <h1>how we fixed macvg from the short maintenence break on april first</h1>
    today was a really bad day, because github desktop couldn't allow the huge game site to be updated, making the macvg game site unavailable. so the macvg april update is pretty big so i copied the entire folder to the remote repository folder, but github desktop took way too long to update the entire folder and push it to remote repository, so the remote disconnected many times, and i deleted all the files prior to this, so the game site was completely empty, and then i researched and tried a lot of things, neither of them succeeded, until i found out that each time github desktop pushes, it only pushes the changed files, so if i divide the macvg folder into multiple sections, and upload each section one by one using github desktop, the problem could be solved and all the games will be back on macvg, but it wouold take a long time. so i slowly uploaded 30 games at a time, then 40, then 50, and repeat, ultil all the games are up and all the other files and stuff for macvg are all released and pushed to the remote github repository. so that's how we fixed this huge macvg issue in just 2 hours. yay!!!
