  "date": "11.30.2023 ~ 3.1.2024",
  "description": "Note that this isn't really a prerelease update log, as MacBlog was already released since the first log on this page. This is just a collection of not very detailed updates before the huge official 2024 April update. Also the dates aren't accurate so yeah. So here are all the changes we made to MacBlog before April 2024.",

    "p1": "This is a relatively larger update (it's actually a bundle of smaller updates) than the others, as we improved your MacBlog experience by quite a lot this update, so let's see what's new. First, we have the MacBlog Rebranding: New logo, appearance, and color. Originally, we used a dark blue color for logo, gold for accent, and a lot of other random colors, but in this update, we changed both the logo and accent color to purple, which doesn't only distinguish MacBlog from other MacWeb apps, it also makes your experiecne more clean, modern, organized, and comfortable. Purple also represents ambition, and MacBlog is a place where we share our \"ambitious\" plans and other info about MacWeb, making purple a perfect fit. We also added a collapsible help menu, feedback form, and other helpful resources about MacBlog, making its experience more unified with other MacWeb apps. We also fixed broken pages, navigation problems, styling issues, pages not showing, and project pages, removed the About tab because added a collapsible menu with that link. This unifies MacBlog experience with other MacWeb apps, removed outdated and unrelated information and content on MacBlog because of roadmap and project plan changes, removed and reorganized files and content, installed Google Analytics on every page for better user experience tracking, which helps us improve MacBlog. Finally, here's the future of MacBlog: we haven't really focused on working on MacBlog, as you can see, a lot of pages aren't working or lacking stuff and features that need to be fixed. In the next couple updates we'll hopefully be focusing on MacBlog's content, user interface, and features, making its quality better and more user friendly for everyone to see related information about MacWeb.",
