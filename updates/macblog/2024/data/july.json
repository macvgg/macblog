    "p3": "MacBlog is your information hub for MacWeb, and it doesn't need new features or that much attention seeing that it's just an info center. Because there isn't a lot to update on MacBlog, so we'll be ditching the old monthly update schedule for MacBlog (we never did it anyway), and we'll be having random cummulative updates on an irregular interval. These kinds of updates are a bundle of stuff we did during the period to make the update have more content or changes. We'll be releasing these updates on the first day of a month, as usual, and our other apps won't be affected by this change ðŸ“…."
