    "sh1": "NEW BETA COURSE: CSS!",
    "p1": "As we promised, we're realing the brand new and long waited new course: MacLearn CSS Course, in the fall of 2024, but before that, we need to roll out the beta version for testing and feedback purposes to make MacLearn more perfect. That's why we're releasing the beta course to everyone in this update, with tons of new tutorials, content, topics, quizzes, units, and so much more about CSS! Although we're still massively updating the beta course and its articles, we're releasing it to the public for you to learn a bit more and give feedback to improve MacLearn! We hope to turn MacLearn into the best platform to aquire an important skill, that's why we're constantly releasing and updating courses about web development, and make you a master of it! With the addition of the CSS course, MacLearn will have more resources than ever for a beginner like you to learn about web dev üÜï!",
    "sh2": "NEW LEARNING PATH!",
    "p2": "We completely replanned the learning paths of our courses to make your learning experience the most efficient, effective, and easy way to learn and master a new skill! Previously, we only had two units with two quizzes with a bunch of tutorials, but now, we seperated articles into smaller units that have tutorials focusing on the same topic, boosting the efficiency on understanding. We also added a bunch new quizzes at the end of each smaller unit (that's a lot more quizzes!) to make you practice and think about what you learned to root your understanding. With these changes, it's easier than ever to learn, practice, review, and master the skill with a better flow of knowledge üó∫Ô∏è!",
    "sh3": "NEW COURSE STRUCTURES!",
    "p3": "Along with the seperation of smaller units focusing on a key topic, we seperated each course into two sections: Beginner and Advanced, each with 5 to 8 different subunits with a quiz at the end of each subunit. That makes a total of almost 20 quizzes and exercises in a course, meaning that you have more opportunites to practice what you've learned on the key topics, and move on to focus on the next. There's also new buttons at the bottom of the side bar that takes you to the previous or the next section, for easier navigation between the large collection of resources here on MacLearn üè´!",
    "sh4": "CONTENT UPDATES!",
    "p4": "Because of the major updates on our course structure, there's a lot to be updated! We created a bunch of new tutorials and articles to provide even more knowledge and resources on the key topics of the subunits, and we also updated the content of each article to be more accurate and focused on the key topic. On top of that, we released new quizzes that also focus on the key topics, to make sure you've really mastered that subunit! We also updated some outdated content and reorganized some files and folders for a cleaner, faster, and smoother experience on MacLearn üî•!",
    "sh5": "APPEARANCE UPDATES!",
    "p5": "With the constant improvements on the styling of MacWeb apps, many of MacLearn's older pages and articles are getting out of date, so we updated our styling on MacLearn Playground to look more modern and match with the new designs of MacLearn. We also updated some older pages' layouts and appearance to fix broken styling and to make the pages look more clean and unified with other MacLearn pages. We also applied some minor changes to the genral appearance of MacLearn. Enjoy the new refreshed look of the pages üñåÔ∏è!"
