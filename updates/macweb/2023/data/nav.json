  "description": "To be honest, MacWeb was a huge mess before the release of Site Material. Site Material is a new way to imagine MacWeb, it specifies the styling and looks of a MacWeb app, it also determines how MacWeb app works. Site Material makes our apps look unified, modern, and functional. It makes your experience with MacWeb better, more modern, and more seamless than ever. Let's see what's new with this version of Site Material:",

    "p1": "We're clearing things out on how MacWeb apps work. The navigation bar on the top of each app guides you through different Tabs, or pages and subapps, of that app. It's a quick way for you to navigate through that MacWeb app.",
    "sh2": "SIDEBAR",
    "p2": "Sidebar is a little bit different than the navigation bar. The navigation bar navigates you in the app, but the sidebar navigates you out of the app, into different MacWeb apps. It basically guides you through the entire MacWeb system. It appears when you hit your cursor to the left edge of the screen, and there's gonna be a small vertical bar that pops up with app logos, allowing you to navigate."
