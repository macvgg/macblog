    "p1": "We gave each of our apps a distinct main color so you can distinct them easily from each other, and it also looks more vibrant with the vivid colors. We gave MacLearn a blue color, which associates with growth and education, so it perfectly reflects the purpose of MacLearn. We also gave MacTime a green color, which means management and improvement, and MacVG orange, which means excitement and vibrancy. We gave MacBlog a purple color, which associates with information. This change unifies the appearance of each page in MacWeb apps, distincts each app from each other, and it has a better look than the old color schemes with random colors being used. This is a huge improvement on design. The new colors are used as the logo color, accent color, and primary color within each app, with mainly neutral background.",
