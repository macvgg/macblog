    "sh1": "NEW TAB: Timer!",
    "p1": "This is definitely one of the most important, fundational, and useful features for MacTime. What is a time app when it doesn't have a count down timer? So we're introducing a count down timer that can count down from 5 seconds to more than 10 minutes! As this is more of a fundational feature update, we only developed the basic features, with a Start/End button, time display, and a progress bar that shows how much time has passed. This is a very simple but powerful tab. Don't worry, more advanced features and customizations are coming to MacTime Timer in future updates, so stay tuned âŒ›!",
    "sh2": "NEW COLLAPSIBLE MENU",
    "p2": "Following the release of MacWeb Site Material 2, we introduced the sidebar on different MacWeb apps and other appearance changes, including the brand new collapsible menus. We're also adding a collapsible menu in MacTime: Help! Help is where you can get update information, app documentation, feedback, and more support directly from MacTime, so you won't have any trouble using any of our apps while also using MacTime in the most effective way ðŸ“ƒ!",
    "sh3": "What's the Future of MacTime?",
    "p3": "For the first few updates since v.0.5 release, we'll continue pushing out basic and foundational features like Time, Stopwatch, Focus... , and after these basic features are all settled, we'll be rolling out more customizations, settings, and other options on these tabs for a more advanced user experience when using MacTime in later updates. So stay tuned, because you're gonna want to use the powerful MacTime app for your daily tasks ðŸ”®! "
