         MacIdeas, this amazing productivity app by MacWeb, has been through A LOT of updates, changes, and revamps. It was originally developed and called Ify in the August of 2023, and then got acquired by MacWeb in fall 2023 and was renamed to MacWork with a brand new interface, appearance, features, and many others new features planned to be added but wasn't published. It got abandoned for a while but picked up again in April 2024, and was completely reimagined again. It was renamed to MacIdeas and had a new roadmap, new appreance, new features, and more planned in the future. See all the updates from these seperate phases below! For all the updates after the June 2024 release of MacIdeas, see the detailed dedicated articles for them on the left sidebar! The prerelase logs aren't detailed and it's very chaotic, so beware.
