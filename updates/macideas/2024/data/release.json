    "sh6": "NEW APPEARANCE",
    "p6": "Brand new app comes with a brand new appearance! Other than the standard MacWeb Site Material 3 on each of our apps, MacIdeas has its own appearance. On the left of each tab is the sidebar, which contains a list of your tasks, notes, or lists. There's also folders and other features on the sidebar that we'll release in the future. On the right is the main area, where you can create, edit, and manage your tasks, notes, or lists. More features will also be added to boost your productivity in the future updates, so stay tuned üé®!",
    "sh7": "NEW UPDATE SCHEDULE",
    "p7": "Just like the new update schedule we recently appiled to every other MacWeb app execpt for MacVG, MacIdeas is getting an update every 2 months. We made this change because we believe that quality is more important than quantity, and every app should have \"quality\" development time before rushing out an update, so all the apps get \"quality\" features without bugs, while giving our developers a \"quality\" break time. This means that each update comes with more features and changes that are refined and tested, ensuring the \"quality\" of the app üìÖ!"
