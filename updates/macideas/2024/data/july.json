    "sh1": "Notes Rework",
    "p1": "Taking notes is one of the most important aspects on productivity, education, and many other jobs, but MacIdeas Notes didn't work properly before the update. That's why we completely reworked Notes and reimagined it from the ground up. Notes now feature a clean backdrop for you to jot down the important notes, and a floating tool bar at the bottom for key functionalities that help you when taking notes such as bolding, font size, and more coming in the future. This change makes the app clean and simple, with much more space to work with your notes comfortably. We also remade the sidebar on Notes so you can actually rename, delete, and manage different notes now. With this major rework, you can finally jot down notes at your convenience with powerful managing and editing features with MacIdeas Notes üìù!",
    "sh2": "Lists Rework",
    "p2": "The old Lists worked fine, but the appearance and the features of it didn't match up with MacWeb and our expectations. That's why we also completed reworked, reimagined, and remade MacIdeas Lists from scratch. Now, there's a side bar on the left of the screen, just like Tasks and Notes, that enables you to create, rename, delete, and manage your different lists with ease. With the powerful sidebar, you can have multiple lists at the same time, making it easier than ever to organize your items and work. Lists now also has a brand new UI. Similar to tasks, type an item in the input field, and viola, you've added a new item to the list! Enjoy the new interface with powerful new features like edit, delete, and more to work with your items! We made Lists easier and more powerful than ever with this major rework üî•!",
    "sh3": "Tasks Updates",
    "p3": "We fixed a bunch of bugs in Tasks, from managing task items to renaming the task list, you can now enjoy a seamless smooth bugless task management app with refined features to manage your tasks and your workflow üõ†Ô∏è!",
    "sh4": "Bug Fixes",
    "p4": "Other than the bugs fixed in Tasks, we also fixed a bunch of navigation, appearance, and managing issues on other tabs to make your experience on MacIdeas faster and more optimized ü™≤!"
